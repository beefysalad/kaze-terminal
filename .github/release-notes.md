## What’s new in Kaze 0.29

- **Battery on macOS:** MacBooks now show the battery at the far right of the status bar too, just like Windows laptops: the level and percent, a bolt while charging, amber at 20% and red at 10%. It updates when macOS says the level or the charger changed, so it costs nothing while idle. Mac desktops show nothing.

## Opening it the first time

Kaze isn't signed by Apple or Microsoft yet, so both warn you the first time.

**macOS:** unzip, then drag **Kaze** into Applications and open it. macOS says it can't verify the app: click **Done**, open **System Settings › Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** next to Kaze. You only do this once. (Or, in Terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Kaze.app`.)

**Windows:** unzip and run `kaze.exe`. If SmartScreen says "Windows protected your PC", click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. If Smart App Control is on, it may block unsigned apps with no way past it; building from source works then.

Build from source instead: see the [README](https://github.com/beefysalad/kaze-terminal#build-and-run-from-a-clone).
